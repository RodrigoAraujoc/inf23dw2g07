# C1 : My work assignment title

## Description

In this project we intend to create a library for games. Something similar to the Library on the App Steam. It will let you add your games to your own library from a database of different games. The user will also be able to comment once per game in a specific section added to the library where they will be able to evaluate the game as they want.
